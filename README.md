# Group-ASE-client

## Getting started

This is the client-side code for a Book E-Commerce web application developed by Group ASE as part of the FS23 Advanced Software Engineering course.

## Prerequisites and Installation
 All dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```




Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```





Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### Testing

```npm install cypress --save-dev```


Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. 
### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
